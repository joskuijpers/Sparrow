import Metal

/*
 This whole struct needs a lot of work.
 Do we want to allow changes? We should keep the number of materials to a minimum
 so using a class and shared/unshared materials might be a good idea.
 
 Then using a var everywhere and marking as dirty might be a good idea as well
 as it allows changing the material at runtime.
 If dirty it would need a new pipeline.
 
 We should store a list of generated materials somewhere and keep an ID so we
 can easily sort. Or we sort on pointer which would work without extra steps.
